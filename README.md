### 🚀 Projects & Research

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on:

- **🔐 Unlearning Inversion Attack:**
  Ongoing research on **AI Privacy**, investigating the feasibility of reconstructing "forgotten" data from machine unlearning models using **TabLeak** attacks.

- **🛡️ Enterprise Network Defense (Blue Team Defense Simulation):**
  Designed and implemented a **Defense in Depth** architecture for a simulated enterprise network. Deployed **Wazuh (SIEM)**, **pfSense (Firewall)**, **Suricata (IPS)**, and **ModSecurity** to monitor, detect, and mitigate Red Team attacks (DDoS, SQLi, Webshells,...) in real-time.

- **📡 Zabbix Monitoring System:**
  Deployed a centralized **Zabbix** solution to monitor **Windows & Linux** infrastructure. Configured **Active/Passive Agents** and **Web Scenarios** to track system health and service uptime, ensuring high availability via automated **Email Alerts**.

- **🩺 HealthTrust (AI-Powered Platform):**
  Built a comprehensive web platform for personal health monitoring, integrated with AI features for medical consultation and diagnosis support.

- **☁️ Secure Cloud EHR System:**
  Architected a secure electronic health record sharing scheme using **Hybrid Cryptography (CP-ABE + AES)** for fine-grained access control.
